### What is this?
This is a simple C#/WinForms tool to graphically visualise/interpret arbitrary bytes as an image, in different color formats.

### Quick guide
The interface should be pretty explanatory. Drag any file on top of the app, or open it through the menu, and you should immediately see an image. Drag the sliders on the right to adjust the view. The options menu can be used to create a larger-than-the-default 2048x1000 view.
